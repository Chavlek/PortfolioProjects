# PortfolioProjects

## Two provided .csv files in the repo were used to explore the COVID data

1) CovidDeaths1.csv
2) CovidVaccs1.csv

## The First Exploratory analysis is presented in:

1) Covid_SQL_DataExploration_noOuts.ipynb
2) Covid_SQL_DataExploration.ipynb

Because of the large file size, SQL query outputs were removed from Covid_SQL_DataExploration_noOuts.ipynb so it can be previewed directly on GitHub
